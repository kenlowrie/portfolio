	    <h1>Online Portfolio</h1>
        <p>I created this online portfolio to <em>showcase</em>
        a few of the different <em>projects</em> that I've done over the years, to give you
        some <em>ideas <span class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></span></em> of what I can do for you. Some of these are
        <em>new</em> and others are <em>not</em> so new; in some cases, I have made <em>minor
        updates</em> to them, and the rest are pretty much <em>as-is</em>,
        with the exception of some <em>tweaks</em> to get them running on this site. The site is
        organized into two <em>(2)</em> sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#portfolio">Media Production</a> - Video, Photography & Graphic Design projects.</li>
            <li><a href="#swdev">Software Development</a> - Development and Website deployment projects.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Hopefully this will give you some <em>insight</em> as to what I can bring to the
        table for your <em>project</em> and/or your <em>organization,</em> whether it's <em>video </em>production, <em>photography,</em> software <em>development </em>
        or simply the <em>deployment </em> of a <em>website</em>. I look forward to discussing your <em>project/position</em>
        requirements with you in the <em>near future!</em></p>
        <p>Best regards,</p><br />

        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>This portfolio landing page is <em>responsive</em> and was coded to show how
        you can build web pages that automatically adapt to the screen size of the device
        being used display it. On this page, I am using
        the popular <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework because it has a lot of great features
        for building responsive websites that are easy to use. 
        There are also many great examples of <em>"tested"</em> code that can be
        readily used in your site, which <em>saves</em> development <em>time</em> and cuts down on <em>bugs! <span class="fa fa-bug"></span></em>
        </p><p>Some of the inner web pages that make up this portfolio are also
        hand coded, and you can download the <em>source</em> code for these pages from my
        GitHub page <a href="https://www.github.com/kenlowrie/portfolio" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>As you
        browse through my portfolio, you will also find websites that were NOT hand
        coded by me; I simply <em>deployed and customized</em> them. The majority 
        are based on <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> which is my favorite CMS application to use and
        install for clients.</p>
