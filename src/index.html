        <p>I put this website together to showcase some
        of the projects that I've done, so you can
        get a better idea of what I can do for you. Some of these projects
        are new, and others I did in the past; in some cases, I made minor
        updates to them for this portfolio, and others are pretty much as-is. I have
        organized this site into <em>3</em> sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#portfolio">Media Production</a> - Video and Photography projects.</li>
            <li><a href="#swdev">Software Development</a> - Development projects.</li>
            <li><a href="#webs">Websites</a> - Website development and deployment projects.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I hope the site gives you a better idea of what I can bring to the
        table for your project, be it video production, photography, software development
        or simply the deployment of a website. I look forward to discussing your project
        requirements with you in the near future!</p>
        <p>Best regards,</p><br />

				<h1>About</h1>

        <p>This portfolio landing page is <em>responsive</em> and was coded to show how
        you can build web pages that automatically adapt to the screen size of the device
        being used display it. On this page, I am using
        the popular <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework because it has a lot of great features
        for building responsive websites that are easy to use. 
        There are also many great examples of "tested" code that can be
        readily used in your site, which <em>saves development time</em> and cuts down on <em>bugs! <span class="fa fa-bug"></span></em>
        </p><p>Some of the inner web pages that make up this portfolio are also
        hand coded, and you can <em>download the source</em> code for these pages from my
        GitHub page <a href="https://www.github.com/kenlowrie">here</a>.</p><p>As you
        browse through my portfolio, you will also find websites they were NOT hand
        coded by me; I simply <em>deployed and customized</em> them. The majority 
        are based on <a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> which is one of my favorite CMS applications to use and
        install for clients.</p>
