            <p>This part of my <em>online portfolio</em> contains a few software projects that I've worked on over the years. I'm in the process of cleaning them up and posting them as they are ready, so check back now and then to see what's new.</p>
            <p>I worked in the software industry for over <em>25 years</em>, although most of that code was for <em>shrink-wrap</em> applications, so I can't post any of that here. Given that, I went back through a number of things I've built over the years to find some samples.</p>
            <p>As I complete them, I am uploading them to <a href="https://github.com/kenlowrie/portfolio" _target="_blank">Github</a>, and then I'll update the links below to route you to a version you can review. If you have any questions about them, please feel free to <a href="mailto:ken@klowrie.net">contact me</a>.</p>
