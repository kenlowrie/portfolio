        <h1>Software Development</h1>
        <p>This part of my <em>online portfolio</em> contains a few software projects that I've worked on over the years. I'm in the process of cleaning them up and posting them as they are ready, so check back now and then to see what's new.</p>
        <p>I worked in the software industry for over <em>25 years</em>, although most of that code was for <em>shrink-wrap</em> applications, so I can't post any of that here. Given that, I went back through a number of things I've built over the years to find some samples.</p>
        <p>As I complete them, I am uploading them to <a href="https://github.com/kenlowrie/portfolio" _target="_blank">Github</a>, and then I'll update the links below to route you to a version you can review. If you have any questions about them, please feel free to <a href="mailto:ken@klowrie.net">contact me</a>.</p>

                  This is a sample database application built in PHP and using MySQL. I originally wrote this to keep track of a home movie and video game collection, back before there was NetFlix, Hulu and Amazon Prime... you know, streaming.<br /><br />You will be able to download the source code for this application from my Github page as soon as it's up and running.

                  This is a sample web app that can be used to structure video content.<br /><br />This app was written as a way to organize a video training course that I developed over the past couple of years. There were too many videos to just line them up on the page, so I put this together to solve that problem.<br /><br />Source code will be available on my Github page once it's up and running.
